# TODOLS

## A todolist manager

I wanted to have a working todolist but struggled to make anything worked, so I started making my own in bash to get something perfect for myself but also to learn bash.

## `todo.sh`

The `todo.sh` file is very simple, and I use it as a placeholder for the actual program. The ideas I have are listed in a somewhat free way, hopefully they are understandable. I am unaware if they are able to make in my freetime but hopefully they will be added to the program. I am right working on adding todos to an xml file.

# Example

        > ./todo.sh todo.txt
        TODO List:
        ==========
        1. Make a github repo
        2. Study for the exam

where the todos are colored based on the last word in the `todo.txt` file.

| Keyword       | Color         |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| viktig        | Red           |
| medel         | Yellow        |
| lite          | Cyan          |
| Ã¶vrigt        | Magenta       |

These are swedish words, I suggest changing them if you plan to use this at this early stage.
