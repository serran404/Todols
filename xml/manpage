This is a beginning to a manpage for my todols. 

After every command the to-do list is shown, and if no OPTION is set it is only shown.

What attributes will be shown is configured in the settings file (I have not created this yet tihi).

OPTIONS
	-a NAME, --add=NAME
	To add a to-do with the tag NAME to the tree.

	-p TAG, --parent_tag=TAG
	If -a is active this adds the to-do beneath the parent TAG.

	-r TAG, --remove=TAG
	Removes the to-do with the tag TAG. If this contains multiple to-dos,
	it is a container/parent, it asks for confirmation.

	-h, --help
	Gives some helpful info.

SETTINGS

These options will be configured in the settings file but as that does not exist I have these here

	-P PRIO, --priority=PRIO
	How important the to-do is. The to-do is colored with the scheme:
	viktig: RED, medel: YELLOW, lite: CYAN, Ã¶vrigt: MAGENTA
	
	-d DATE, --due_date=DATE
	When the task is supposed to be finished.
